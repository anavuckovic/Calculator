# Calculator

A simple yet functional calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and features a dark/light theme toggle.

Features:
  Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform simple calculations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  Backspace Function: Allows you to delete the last character in the input.
  Clear Function: Clears the current input.
  Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Switch between a dark and light theme for the calculator interface.
  Responsive Design: The layout is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.

Tech Stack:
  HTML: Provides the structure for the calculator interface.
  CSS: Styles the calculator and implements the dark and light themes.
  JavaScript: Handles the logic for the calculatorâ€™s operations, backspace, and theme toggling.

Installation:
To run the Calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd calculator
3. Open index.html in a web browser: You can double-click the index.html file to open the project in your default browser.
Alternatively, use a local server (such as Live Server in Visual Studio Code) for a better development experience.

Usage:
  Basic Operations: Click the buttons on the calculator interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.
  Clear: Click the C button to clear the display.
  Backspace: Click the < button to delete the last entered character.
  Equal: Click the = button to calculate the result of the expression entered.
  Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Click the circular icon in the top right corner to switch between the dark and light themes.

Dependencies: No external libraries or frameworks are used in this project. It is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Credits:
  Tutorial: The project was created based on a tutorial by the Not Only Dev YouTube channel.
Icons: No external icon libraries are used for the buttons, but custom icons are included for the theme toggle.

Key Files:
  index.html: Contains the structure and layout of the calculator interface, including buttons for numbers and operations.
  style.css: Provides styling for the calculator and defines the light and dark themes. It also contains styling for button hover effects.
  script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic to handle the calculator's functionality. It listens for button clicks, performs arithmetic calculations, handles backspace functionality, 
  and toggles between light and dark themes.

How It Works:
  Button Event Listeners: The JavaScript code listens for clicks on calculator buttons. When a number or operator button is clicked, it is added to the display screen.
  Clear Button: When the C button is clicked, it clears the screen.
  Backspace Button: The < button removes the last character from the display text.
  Equal Button: The = button evaluates the expression and shows the result. If the input is empty, it displays an error message "Empty!" for 2 seconds.
  Theme Toggle: The theme toggle button switches between the dark and light themes by toggling the dark class on the calculator container.
